## Additional Envato accounts aren't authenticating
Envato's authentication flow doesn't ask which account you want to use. If you attempt to authenticate against Envato and are already logged into any Envato marketplace, Envato will attempt to authenticate against that account. If that account has authenticated with Package Peak already, it'll simply direct you back to your dashboard.

To set up multiple Envato accounts with Package Peak, we recommend using a private browser window to add additional accounts. This will ensure you aren't already logged into any Envato accounts and let you log into the specific Envato account you want to use.

## Some of my purchases aren't appearing
Sometimes a theme or plugin author may not include the installable ZIP file when publishing their plugin or theme. This currently prevents Package Peak from knowing exactly what kind of package this is. Please contact the theme or plugin author and direct their attention to the following field when uploading their plugin or theme to ThemeForest or CodeCanyon:

![Installable file field](./assets/installable-upload.jpg)

In the future, we may include a way for you to manually declare purchases as themes or plugins.
